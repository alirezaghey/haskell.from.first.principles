--     Variable not in scope: greeting :: String

-- 5 |   putStrLn greeting
--   |            ^^^^^^^^
-- Failed, no modules loaded.

-- This means that on line 5 `putStrLn` cant' access `greeting` because it's out of scope.
-- The reason is that `printSecond` does not pass `greeting` as an argument to `putStrLn`.
-- While on line 10 when we call `printSecond` `greeting` is in scope, `putStrLn` in the actual body of `printSecond` won't have access to it unless `printSecond` passes it down.

-- The fix is in `print3brokenFixed.hs`
