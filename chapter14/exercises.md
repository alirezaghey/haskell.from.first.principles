# Solutions to problems of chapter 14

## Intermission: Short Exercise

In the Chapter Exercises at the end of Recursion, you were given this exercise:

Write a function that multiplies two numbers using recursive summation. The type should be `(Eq a, Num a) => a -> a -> a` although, depending on how you do it, you might also
consider adding an Ord constraint.

If you still have your answer, great! If not, rewrite it and then write `hspec` tests for it.

The above examples demonstrate the basics of writing individual tests to test particular values. If you’d like to see a more developed example, you could refer to Chris’s library, [Bloodhound](https://github.com/bitemyapp/bloodhound).

# Rest of exercises have been post poned to when I have learned Monads, Applicative, Functors and some other advanced subjects.
