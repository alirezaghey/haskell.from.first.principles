A monad transformer is a special type that takes a monad as an argument and returns a monad as a result. It allows us to combine two monads into one that shares the behaviors of both, such as allowing us to add exception handling to a `State` monad. It is somewhat common to create a stack of transformers to create one large monad that has features from several monads, for example, rolling `Reader`, `Either`, and `IO` together to get a monad that captures the behavior of waiting for an argument that will get passed around to multiple functions but is likely to come in via some kind of I/O action and has the possibility of failure we might like to catch. Often this stack will be given a type alias for convenience.
