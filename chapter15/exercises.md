## Optional Monoid

Write the `Monoid` instance for your `Maybe` type renamed to `Optional`.'

```hs
data Optional a =
    Nada
  | Only a
  deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Monoid a
      => Monoid (Optional a) where
  mempty  = undefined
  mappend = undefined
```

```hs
data Optional a =
    Nada
  | Only a
  deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Semigroup a
      => Semigroup (Optional a) where
  (Only x)  <> (Only y) = Only (x <> y)
  Nada      <> (Only y) = Only y
  (Only x)  <> Nada     = Only x
  Nada      <> Nada     = Nada

instance Monoid a
      => Monoid (Optional a) where
  mempty      = Nada
  mappend x y = x <> y
```

## Madness

You may have seen mad libs before. The idea is to take a template of phrases, fill them in with blindly selected categories of words, and see if saying the final version is amusing.

Using a lightly edited example from the Wikipedia article on Mad Libs:
```
___________! he said ______ as he<br>
exclamation          adverb
jumped into his car ____ and drove<br>
                    noun
off with his _________ wife."
             adjective
````

We can make this into a function, like the following:

```hs
import Data.Monoid

type Verb           = String
type Adjective      = String
type Adverb         = String
type Noun           = String
type Exclamation    = String

madlibbin'  :: Exclamation
            -> Adverb
            -> Noun
            -> Adjective
            -> String
madlibbin' e adv noun adj =
  e     <> "! he said " <>
  adv   <> " as he jumped into his car " <>
  noun  <> " and drove off with his " <>
  adj   <> " wife."
```

Now you're going to refactor this code a bit! Rewrite it using `mconcat`.

## Maybe Another Monoid

Write a `Monoid` instance for a `Maybe` type which doesn't require a `Monoid` for the contents. Reuse the `Monoid` law `QuickCheck` properties and use them to validate the instance.

Don't forget to write an `Arbitrary` instance for `First'`. We won't always stub that out explicitly for you. We suggest learning how to use the `frequency` function from `QuickCheck` for `First'`s instance.

```hs
newtype First' a =
    First' { getFirst' :: Optional a}
    deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Monoid (First' a) where
  mempty = undefined
  mappend = undefined

firstMappend  :: First' a
              -> First' a
              -> First' a
firstMappend  = mappend

type FirstMappend =
      First' String
  ->  First' String
  ->  First' String
  ->  Bool

type FstId =
  First' String -> Bool

main :: IO ()
main = do
  quickCheck (monoidAssoc :: FirstMappend)
  quickCheck (monoidLeftIdentity :: FstId)
  quickCheck (monoidRightIdentity :: FstId)
```

# Chapter exercises

## Semigroup exercises

Given a datatype, implement the `Semigroup` instance. Add `Semigroup` constraints to type variables where needed. Use the `Semigroup` class from the `semigroups` library (or from base if you are on GHC 8) or write your own. When we use `(<>)`, we mean the infix `mappend` from the `Semigroup` typeclass.

**Note:** We're not always going to derive every instance you may want or need in the datatypes we provide for exercises. We expect you to know what you need and to take care of it yourself by this point.

1. Validate _all_ of your instances with `QuickCheck`. Since `Semigroup`'s only law is associativity, that's the only property you need to reuse. Keep in mind that you'll potentially need to import the modules for `Monoid` and `Semigroup` and to avoid naming conflicts for the `(<>)` depending on your version of GHC.

```hs
data Trivial = Trivial deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Semigroup Trivial where
  _ <> _ = undefined

instance Arbitrary Trivial where
  arbitrary = return Trivial

semigroupAssoc  :: (Eq m, Semigroup m)
                => m -> m -> m -> Bool
semigroupAssoc x y z =
  (x <> y) <> z == x <> (y <> z)

type TrivialAssoc =
  Trivial -> Trivial -> Trivial -> Bool

main :: IO ()
main =
  quickCheck (semigroupAssoc :: TrivAssoc)
```

2. Validate associativity with `QuickCheck`

```hs
newtype Identity a = Identity a
```

3. Validate associativity with `QuickCheck`

```hs
data Two a b = Two a b
```
Hint: Ask for another `Semigroup` instance.

data Three a b c = Three a b c
```

5. Validate associativity with `QuickCheck`

```hs
data Four a b c d = Four a b c d
```

6. Validate associativity with  `QuickCheck`

```hs
newtype BoolConj =
  BoolConj Bool
```
What it should do:

```
位> (BoolConj True) <> (BoolConj True)
BoolConj True
位> (BoolConj True) <> (BoolConj False)
BoolConj False
```

7. Validate associativity with `QuickCheck`

```hs
newtype BoolDisj =
  BoolDisj Bool
```
What it should do:
```
位> (BoolDisj True) <> (BoolDisj True)
BoolDisj True
位> (BoolDisj True) <> (BoolDisj False)
BoolDisj False
```
